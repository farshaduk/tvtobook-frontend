This repository snapshot has been memorized until 2025-11-13.

What was memorized:
- Project: tvtobook (Next.js app)
- Branch: master
- Recent changes made on 2025-11-12:
  - `next.config.ts` updated to remove fallback default for `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (now requires environment variable).
  - `package.json` `build` script corrected to `cross-env NODE_ENV=production next build` (Next 15 uses `output: 'export'`).
  - `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` wrapped `<Header />` in `React.Suspense` to satisfy Next.js prerender requirement for components using `useSearchParams()`.
- Build verification: `npm run build` completed successfully on 2025-11-12 producing static prerendered pages.
